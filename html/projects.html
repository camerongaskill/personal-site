            <p>This was also a assignment from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
                target="blank"><em>Freecodecamp.org</em></a>. This assignment's focus was to create a simple form using a
              variety of inputs from the user. This webpage consists of skills using Html and CSS.
              <a href="https://github.com/camerongaskill/Freecodecamp-Survery-form" target="blank"><u>Here</u> you can find
                the Github repo to this project.</a>

            <p>This was my first website project. It was an assignment from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/"
                target="blank"><em>Freecodecamp.org</em></a>. As you can see, it was a very primitive task that just
              focused on making somewhat of a structure to a webpage. This webpage consists of skills using Html and CSS.
